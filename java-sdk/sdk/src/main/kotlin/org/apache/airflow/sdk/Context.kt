   * Reads [conf] into a new instance of [type]. For example, [type] can be a
   * class with one field per conf key.
   *
   * ```java
   * public static class EtlConf {
   *   public String targetTable; // set from the "target_table" key
   *   public int limit = 100;    // stays 100 when the conf has no "limit" key
   * }
   *
   * EtlConf etl = context.dagRun.getConf(EtlConf.class);
   * ```
   *
   * Each key goes to the field, setter, record component or `@JsonCreator`
   * parameter whose name matches the key when case and underscores are ignored.
   * A key that matches a field exactly wins over the keys that match the same
   * field only when case and underscores are ignored. Objects nested in the
   * conf follow the same rules, including objects in lists and objects that are
   * map values. The keys of a map field stay as written.
   *
   * Keys that match no field are ignored, because other tasks in the run may
   * read them. A field with no matching key keeps its default value. The conf
   * holds only the values that the run was triggered with. This method does not
   * add the defaults of the Dag's params, so in a scheduled run, where the conf
   * is empty, no field has a matching key.
   *
   * The class needs a no-argument constructor and public fields or setters, so
   * a nested class must be `static`. A record and a class with a builder also
   * work. A class with a `@JsonCreator` constructor works when each parameter
   * of the constructor has `@JsonProperty`, which gives the parameter its name.
   * A record component or a constructor parameter with no matching key gets
   * null. If the component or the parameter has a primitive type, this method
   * throws instead. A scheduled run has an empty conf, so a task that reads the
   * conf into a record with a primitive component fails in a scheduled run. In
   * Kotlin, declare the fields with `@JvmField` so that a property such as
   * `isEnabled` keeps its name.
   *
   * To set a field from a key that no Java name can match, such as
   * `target-table`, annotate the field with [ArgName]. The field then takes
   * only that key, as written. You can also read the value of the key from
   * [conf]. Jackson's `@JsonProperty` also sets the key of a field, but other
   * keys still match the name in `@JsonProperty` when case and underscores are
   * ignored. Do not combine `@JsonProperty` with [ArgName] on one field. The
   * SDK keeps Jackson off your compile classpath, so to use a Jackson
   * annotation, add the library that contains the annotation to your build.
   * Annotations such as `@JsonProperty`, `@JsonCreator` and `@JsonAlias` are in
   * `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations`. `@JsonDeserialize` is in
   * `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`.
   *
   * An `OffsetDateTime` or `ZonedDateTime` field keeps the offset in the value
   * instead of moving the date-time to UTC. An integer field drops any fraction,
   * so `5.9` reads as `5` in an `int` field.
   *
   * Keys match this way wherever Jackson reads an object field by field, for
   * example in a class that `@JsonTypeInfo` or `@JsonDeserialize(as = ...)`
   * picks, or in the class of a `@JsonUnwrapped` field. For a builder that
   * `@JsonDeserialize(builder = ...)` names, keys match the names that the
   * builder takes. A key that equals a name in `@JsonAlias` counts as an exact
   * match. Two limits apply to `@JsonTypeInfo`. First, the key that holds the
   * type id must equal the name of the type id. Second, with
   * `use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.DEDUCTION`, Jackson picks the class from the keys as
   * written. A deserializer that `@JsonDeserialize` sets on a class or on a
   * field gets the keys of an object as written. So does a deserializer that a
   * Jackson module on the classpath registers. A converter that
   * `@JsonDeserialize` sets and a delegating `@JsonCreator` also get the keys
   * as written when they take a `Map` or a `JsonNode`. When a converter or a
   * delegating `@JsonCreator` takes a class with fields, keys match the fields
   * of that class.
   *
   * In a class with `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)`, or with a
   * `@JsonUnwrapped` field whose type is a class with fields, Jackson drops two
   * kinds of key without an error. One is a key that matches no field. The
   * other is a key that matches a field when another key has the field's exact
   * name. A class with a `@JsonAnySetter` method receives both kinds of key in
   * that method. Jackson handles the two kinds of key this way even in a task
   * argument or a typed `getXCom`, which otherwise fail on such keys.
   *
   * This method throws [IllegalArgumentException] in these cases:
   *
   * * A value, such as an empty string or `3000000000` for an `int` field,
   *   cannot be converted to the type of its field.
   * * A key holds null for a primitive field, a list holds null for a primitive
   *   array such as `int[]`, or a primitive record component or constructor
   *   parameter has no matching key. To let a field, a component or a parameter
   *   receive null, declare it with a boxed type, such as `Integer`. This
   *   method does not throw when Jackson handles the null on its own. Jackson
   *   handles the null with `@JsonSetter(nulls = Nulls.AS_EMPTY)`, with
   *   `Nulls.SKIP` on a field or a setter, and with a deserializer of the field
   *   that gives a value for null.
   * * Two keys, such as `target_table` and `TARGET_TABLE`, match the same field
   *   after case and underscores are ignored, but neither key matches the field
   *   name exactly.
   * * The class has two fields whose names differ only in case or underscores,
   *   such as `targetTable` and `target_table`. For a field with [ArgName], the
   *   name in [ArgName] counts as the name of the field. For a field of a class
   *   that a `@JsonUnwrapped` field reads, the name of the field includes the
   *   prefix and the suffix from `@JsonUnwrapped`. This method also throws when
   *   the name in [ArgName] on one field equals the name of another field in
   *   the same class or in a superclass. When a field of the class and a field
   *   in the class of a `@JsonUnwrapped` field have equal names, this method
   *   does not throw. The key then goes only to the field of the class itself.
   *   This method checks the class that it reads the conf into even when the
   *   conf is empty, so this method throws in a scheduled run too. The class of
   *   a nested object is checked only when the conf has that nested object.
   *
   * @param type Class to read the conf into.
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException in the cases listed above.
